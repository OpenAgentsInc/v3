# Graphs in OpenAgents

The main screen of the mobile app displays a graph representing the agent's knowledge base. This graph structure is fundamental to how OpenAgents processes and retrieves information.

## Graph Theory Approach

The knowledge base is modeled using graph theory concepts, with information represented as nodes (vertices) connected by edges. This structure creates a rich, interconnected representation of data.

## Representing Data as a Graph

Any corpus of data, such as a codebase, can be represented as a graph:

- Nodes represent discrete pieces of information or concepts
- Edges represent relationships between these nodes
- Nodes may be grouped into communities or topics
- Each community or topic can have its own summary

## Vector Embeddings and Similarity Search

Each node in the graph is associated with a vector embedding, enabling:

- Cosine similarity search between nodes
- Specific information retrieval

This approach, inspired by Microsoft's GraphRAG paper, combines graph-based representation with vector-based similarity search.

## GraphRAG Implementation

OpenAgents implements GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation), a structured, hierarchical approach that improves understanding and reasoning about complex relationships within codebases and user data.

Key aspects of the GraphRAG implementation:

1. **Code Understanding**: Creates a knowledge graph of the codebase to map relationships between components, functions, and data structures.
2. **Query Responses**: Provides contextually relevant responses to user queries about the codebase, features, or documentation.
3. **User Data Analysis**: Applies GraphRAG to user threads and messages for comprehensive understanding of user interactions over time.
4. **Advanced Search**: Enables sophisticated search functionality across threads and messages.

The implementation process includes:
- Defining text units
- Extracting entities and relationships
- Constructing a knowledge graph
- Generating summaries
- Enhancing the query system to leverage the graph structure

## Practical Applications

This graph-based knowledge representation enables complex queries requiring holistic data understanding. Examples:

- "Summarize the auth system of my app"
- "Refactor a component that spans multiple files"

The agent uses the graph to find relevant context for building a prompt, which is then used with an LLM (Large Language Model) to generate answers or perform tasks.

## Benefits

1. Contextual Understanding: The graph structure reveals relationships between different parts of the data.
2. Efficient Retrieval: Vector embeddings and graph traversal enable quick information retrieval.
3. Holistic Analysis: Grouping nodes into communities allows higher-level understanding of data structure.
4. Flexible Querying: Users can ask questions that require synthesizing information from multiple parts of the knowledge base.

This graph-based approach, enhanced by GraphRAG, forms the core of OpenAgents' ability to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries and commands, improving the functionality and user experience of the AI productivity dashboard.
