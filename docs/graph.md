# Graphs in OpenAgents

The main screen of the mobile app allows users to interact with a graph representing the agent's knowledge base. This graph structure is fundamental to how OpenAgents processes and retrieves information.

## Graph Theory Approach

The knowledge base is modeled using concepts from graph theory, where information is represented as nodes (vertices) connected by edges. This structure allows for a rich, interconnected representation of data.

## Representing Data as a Graph

Any given corpus of data, such as a codebase, can be represented as a graph. In this representation:

- Nodes represent discrete pieces of information or concepts
- Edges represent relationships between these nodes
- Nodes may be grouped into communities or topics that are related
- Each community or topic can have its own summary

## Vector Embeddings and Similarity Search

Each node in the graph is associated with a vector embedding. These embeddings allow for:

- Cosine similarity search between nodes
- Specific retrieval of information

This approach borrows from the GraphRAG paper by Microsoft, combining the strengths of graph-based representation with vector-based similarity search.

## GraphRAG Implementation

OpenAgents implements a version of GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation) to enhance its capabilities. GraphRAG is a structured, hierarchical approach that improves the system's ability to understand and reason about complex relationships within codebases and user data.

Key aspects of the GraphRAG implementation include:

1. **Enhanced Code Understanding**: Creating a knowledge graph of the codebase to better understand relationships between components, functions, and data structures.
2. **Improved Query Responses**: Providing more accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries about the codebase, features, or documentation.
3. **Holistic View of User Data**: Applying GraphRAG to user threads and messages for a more comprehensive understanding of user interactions over time.
4. **Advanced Search Capabilities**: Enabling more sophisticated search functionality across threads and messages.

The implementation involves defining text units, extracting entities and relationships, constructing a knowledge graph, generating summaries, and enhancing the query system to leverage this graph structure.

## Practical Applications

This graph-based knowledge representation enables users to make complex queries that require a holistic understanding of the data. For example:

- "Summarize the auth system of my app"
- "Refactor a certain component that spans multiple files"

The agent uses the graph to find the most relevant context for building a prompt. This prompt is then used with an LLM (Large Language Model) to generate an answer or perform the requested task.

## Benefits

1. Contextual Understanding: The graph structure allows the agent to understand relationships between different parts of the data.
2. Efficient Retrieval: By using vector embeddings and graph traversal, the agent can quickly find relevant information.
3. Holistic Analysis: The ability to group nodes into communities allows for higher-level understanding of the data structure.
4. Flexible Querying: Users can ask questions that require synthesizing information from multiple parts of the knowledge base.

This graph-based approach, enhanced by GraphRAG, forms the core of OpenAgents' ability to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries and commands, significantly improving the overall functionality and user experience of the AI productivity dashboard.
