# OpenAgents relay

A custom Nostr relay and NIP-90 service provider

## Example

User wants a voice chat transcribed to begin an agent command flow. ("Update my codebase to...")

The client sends a single NIP-90 event and receives the resulting JSON.

## Tech

- Golang

## Maybe we shouldn't do this

These are combined for now for speed of development; we may split them into two later
