Project Overview:
OpenAgents v3 is the next iteration of the OpenAgents platform, focusing on decentralized AI agents and tools. The project aims to provide a robust framework for creating, managing, and interacting with AI agents using Nostr for communication and Bitcoin for payments.

README Highlights:
- Project structure: mobile (React Native app) and relay (Custom Nostr relay & NIP-90 service provider)
- Key principles: Decentralization, Bitcoin payments, Nostr authentication, Cross-platform support
- Technologies: Bitcoin via Lightning, Nostr, React & React Native, Golang

Tech Stack:
- Backend: Golang
- Frontend: React Native (mobile app)
- Communication: Nostr protocol
- Payments: Bitcoin Lightning Network
- API Integration: Groq API for AI model interactions

Major Functions/Files:
1. relay/internal/nip90/handler.go: Handles NIP-90 events, including audio messages and agent commands
2. relay/internal/groq/tool_use.go: Integrates with Groq API for AI model interactions
3. relay/internal/nip90/agent_command_handler.go: Processes agent command requests
4. relay/internal/nip90/event_logger.go: Logs event details for debugging and monitoring
5. relay/internal/nip90/response_handler.go: Manages responses to agent commands

Codebase Observations:
- The project is well-structured with clear separation of concerns
- Extensive use of Go interfaces for flexibility and testability
- Integration with Groq API for AI capabilities
- Custom implementation of Nostr relay functionality
- Focus on security and decentralization in the architecture

Next Steps:
1. Implement SQLite database for caching repository contexts
2. Develop the repository indexing process in IndexRepository function
3. Enhance error handling and implement retry mechanisms for API calls
4. Optimize the context summarization process for large codebases
5. Implement more sophisticated AI agent interactions using Groq API
6. Expand the mobile app functionality to interact with the custom Nostr relay
7. Develop and integrate Bitcoin Lightning Network payment features
8. Implement comprehensive testing suite for all components
9. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
10. Create detailed documentation for developers and users
